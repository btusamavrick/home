    <h3>1. Introduction</h3>
    <p>Welcome to GameVerse ("we," "us," "our"). We are committed to protecting your privacy and handling your data in an open and transparent manner. This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, process, and safeguard your information when you use our website, services, and platform (collectively, the "Services"). Our Services are designed to provide a premier competitive gaming experience, and the data we collect is essential for operating our platform, ensuring fair play, and fostering a vibrant community. By creating an account or using our Services, you agree to the collection and use of information in accordance with this policy.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="card">
    <h3>2. Data Collection Practices</h3>
    <p>We collect information to provide and improve our Services. The types of information we collect can be broken down into several categories:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Account Information:</strong> When you register for a GameVerse account, we collect personal identifiers such as your chosen username, email address, and password. You may also voluntarily provide additional information, such as a profile picture or links to your social media accounts.</li>
      <li><strong>Game and Performance Data:</strong> To operate our leaderboards and tournaments, we collect data related to your in-game activity. This includes your in-game username (Gamertag), match history, win/loss records, scores, and other performance metrics (e.g., K/D ratio, accuracy). This data is collected either through direct integration with game developer APIs or through user-submitted results.</li>
      <li><strong>Technical Information:</strong> We automatically collect certain technical data when you access our Services. This includes your IP address, browser type and version, operating system, device information, and usage data such as pages visited, time spent on pages, and clickstream data. This information helps us understand how users interact with our platform, diagnose technical issues, and improve our Services.</li>
      <li><strong>Communication Data:</strong> If you contact our support team, participate in our forums, or use our chat features, we collect the information you provide in your communications. This includes support tickets, forum posts, and chat logs.</li>
      <li><strong>Payment Information:</strong> For users subscribing to our premium services (Vanguard, Titan), we use third-party payment processors (e.g., Stripe, PayPal) to handle transactions. We do not store your full credit card number or financial details on our servers. We only receive a transaction confirmation, which may include your name and the last four digits of your card.</li>
    </ul>
  </div>
  <div class="card">
    <h3>3. Use of Your Information</h3>
    <p>We use the information we collect for various purposes, all aimed at delivering a world-class competitive gaming experience:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>To Provide and Maintain our Services:</strong> Your account and game data are essential for creating and managing tournaments, updating leaderboards, and providing personalized player profiles.</li>
      <li><strong>To Ensure Competitive Integrity:</strong> We analyze gameplay data and use technical information to detect and prevent cheating, fraud, and other violations of our Terms of Service. This is critical to maintaining a fair playing field for all users.</li>
      <li><strong>To Communicate with You:</strong> We use your email address to send important service-related announcements, such as tournament reminders, password resets, and updates to our policies. With your consent, we may also send you marketing communications about new features, games, and events.</li>
      <li><strong>To Improve and Personalize the Services:</strong> We analyze usage data to understand user behavior and preferences. This allows us to improve the user interface, develop new features, and personalize the content and recommendations you see.</li>
      <li><strong>To Provide Customer Support:</strong> We use communication data to respond to your inquiries, troubleshoot problems, and provide assistance.</li>
    </ul>

      <li><strong>Deletion:</strong> You can request the deletion of your account and associated personal data. Please note that for reasons of competitive integrity, some anonymized gameplay data (e.g., match results without your username) may be retained. Furthermore, we may be required to retain certain information for legal or security purposes.</li>
      <li><strong>Opt-Out of Marketing:</strong> You can unsubscribe from our marketing emails at any time by clicking the 'unsubscribe' link at the bottom of each email.</li>
