    <div class="card">
      <details class="faq-item">
        <summary>How do I create a GameVerse account?</summary>
        <div class="answer"><p>Creating an account is simple and free! Just click the "Sign Up" button on our homepage. You'll need to provide a unique username, a valid email address, and a secure password. After you submit the form, we'll send a verification link to your email.

      <details class="faq-item">
        <summary>How do I change my username or email address?</summary>
        <div class="answer"><p>You can change your username once every 90 days. To do so, navigate to your 'Account Settings' page, where you'll find an option to edit your profile information. Please note that your profile URL will change along with your username. To change your email address, you will need to go through a verification process to confirm ownership of the new email. This is a security measure to protect your account.</p></div>

    <h2>Gameplay & Tournaments</h2>
    <div class="card">
      <details class="faq-item">
        <summary>How do I join a tournament?</summary>
        <div class="answer"><p>Navigate to the 'Games' or 'Tournaments' page and browse the list of upcoming events. Once you find a tournament you'd like to enter, click on it to view the details page. If registrations are open, you'll see a 'Register' button. Click it, confirm your entry, and you're in! Be sure to read the tournament rules and be online for the check-in period, which typically starts 30-60 minutes before the event begins.</p></div>

      <details class="faq-item">
        <summary>How does the ELO ranking system work?</summary>
        <div class="answer"><p>Our ELO system is a skill-based rating model. Every player starts with a baseline ELO score. When you win a match, you gain points, and when you lose, you lose points. The amount of ELO exchanged depends on the rating difference between you and your opponent. Beating a much higher-ranked player will earn you more points than beating someone ranked lower than you. This ensures your rank is an accurate reflection of your skill relative to the rest of the player base.</p></div>
      </details>
      <details class="faq-item">
        <summary>What happens if my opponent doesn't show up for a match?</summary>
        <div class="answer"><p>If your opponent does not check in or join the game lobby within the designated time (usually 10 minutes after the match is scheduled), you can report a 'No Show' on the match page. Our system will verify their absence, and you will be awarded a default win, allowing you to advance in the tournament.</p></div>

        <summary>The website is loading slowly. What can I do?</summary>
        <div class="answer"><p>First, try clearing your browser's cache and cookies, as old data can sometimes cause performance issues. Ensure you have a stable internet connection.

        <summary>My match result was reported incorrectly. How can I fix this?</summary>

You will be required to submit evidence, such as a screenshot of the end-game scoreboard. A tournament administrator will then review the evidence from both players and make a final ruling to correct the result.</p></div>
